# M (1931)

## Movie Impressions

- Could cut out the middle hour of the movie and still would be intelligible
  - Maybe even a better movie

- Weird Sound
  - Cars without sound
  - No background music
  - No footsteps
  - 5 minutes without sound at all

- Good Job leaving up text long enough to read

- Everything seemed really clean
  - Particularly considering how much littering they did

- Larger number of sets than expected for the time period
  - The bank had multiple sets when it could have only had a few

- Cool shots where they moved the camera through a window
  - You could see them move the pane of glass

- Lots of mirror/reflections in the imagery of the film
  - Murderer with the reflection of knives

- Every character design is man with coat and hat
  - Cool juxtaposition of scenes with the cops and mod discussing essentially
    the same plan
  - Fatty - lead investigator
  - Shriker - 3 time manslaughterer mafia boss
  - Franz - Guy who got left behind in the bank/office building
  - And no other names

- First film to use long tracking shots

## Theme

- Is someone with a disease guilty or not guilty

- Surprisingly nuanced ideas of mental illness for 1931
  - Characters very critical of the idea of people being locked up
    - They might just escape
  - However this might be the director being critical of this mentality of
    thinking

- Also anti mob-justice

- Apparently director also claimed that this film was about making moms watch
  after their children
  - But definitely not

## Final Rating

- Becky - I agree [with Parker]
- Chris - Slow but with a surprising in nuanced, if rushed, ending
- Danielle - Surprisingly not a murder mystery. Different from anything I'd
  seen before.
- Hayden - Slow to start but once it got running it got better then culminated
  with the speech then crashed.
- Micah - A lot better than expected but surprise how well it held up. Abrupt
  ending and had technical limitations due to the time it was made.
- Parker - Better than I though it would be
