# The Silence Of The Lambs

## Bennett

- Big take away from the movie was "men are bad but trans women are worse"
- At 2x speed the southern accent sounded fine
  - Sounded a little like Hannah B
- Hannibal talked really fast
- Acting and framing of the story 
- Liked the pacing..engaged for the whole movie
- This movie wanted to be about sexism
  - Jodie Foster constantly ignored
  - Everyone hit on her
- The beginning of this movie was helped because I thought it was about
  Hannibal Lecter
- As a person who couldn't hear Hannibal talk, thought he was cool but didn't
  understand the 5 minute escape sequence

## Chris

- This movie is Sir Anthony Hopkins the movie
  - With only 16 minutes of screen time his presence dominated the entire story
  - The rest of the story was fine but the Hannibal parts definitely make this
    movie for me

## Danielle

- This movie gave me the creeps...but in a good way
  - It was supposed to
- Story was good
- Acting good
  - Jodie Foster's accent was bad
    - I wanted her to sound like Hannah B
- Sir Anthony Hopkins very good in this movie
- Interesting story
- Well executed
- We don't love violence against women
- Didn't love the trans aspect of it
  - A bit cringe
- Solid file
  - High B tier low A tier
- Good opening with Jodie running in the woods, felt like she would get
  murdered
- This movie did pass the Bechdel Test

## Micah

- No one listens to the woman
  - The only commentary is that it exists because that's how life is
- Big tension
  - Not so much scary
- One of the first time heart was racing the entire time
- Probably A tier
- Not a fan of the trans aspects
  - Not understood in 1991, can't age well
  - At least they acknowledged that being trans doesn't make you violent
- Enjoyed how much they left Hannibal's story ambiguous

## Parker

- This movie was scary 8 years ago and I didn't like it
- Appreciate that this movie was actually frightening rather than jump scares
