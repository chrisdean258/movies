# Die Hard

## Bennett

- Most important part was blowing up glass with special effects
- Fun, with no point to cut out
  - Minus cutting out the entire movie
- Beginning and end meaningful, the rest action
  - But the action was the point
- The movie did not feel like it had a lot of filler, unless all of it was
  filler
- Cop shot a kid but wasn't in jail...sure sure
- What is the character growth from cop who wont shoot people to one who will
- An Xmas movie
  - Takes place during Xmas but not super Xmasy


## Chris

- Touchscreen CRT was laughably bad
- Fun action movie
- An Xmas movie
  - Takes place during Xmas

## Danielle

- Why wasn't the video director faster than a book
- Movie followed several Christmas movie themes...but not all of them
- An Xmas movie
- Good break from other Xmas movies

## Hannah

- Die hard is a movie to watch with your dad
  - "This is the best Xmas movie of all time"
    - Dave Hajdik
- Good action movie
  - And doesn't usually like action movies

## Micah

- Movie was fine
- The character were fun
- Maybe I don;t care much for action movies but this one was good
- Liked Hans pretending to be a police officer
- Liked the dynamic of John Maclean and the cop
- Though the cops were in on the heist because they were so stupid
- Liked Argyle
- Liked the 90s hacker
- Liked the touchscreen CRT
- "There are rules for policemen"
  - Bu that other cop shot a kid
- Considering it an Xmas movie is the funniest of the two options
