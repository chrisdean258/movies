# The Prestige

## Bennett

- Vibes are that the this movie is OK and Berat likes it and good
  cinematography

## Berat

- Love this movie
- So good
- Just a fun movie
- Nothing bad about the movie
- Loved killing the bird as foreshadowing the entire movie
- Woke up and asked Hannah "Have you seen The Prestige?"
- Really liked the movie
- Hugh Jackman's character is horrible

## Chris

- Plots a mess
- Characters are doing what
- Not great
- Why are the main characters massive narcissists

## Danielle

- I don't like this movie
- It's boring
- Don't think I like movies that involve magicians
  - Big anti magician
- Christopher Nolan has never met a woman before
  - All Nolan women make weird decisions
- Does not pass the Bechdel Test
- Hate Christian Bale so much throughout the movie
  - And then the end comes and I hate Hugh Jackman
- Really dumb
  - Tesla actually invented cloning tech
  - But Edison covered it up
- Christian Bale's thing is destroying his and his brother's life and everyone
  they interact with
- David Bowie is the highlight

## Micah

- This movie is bad
- Was hoping it was about wizards, not stage performers
- Kinda hate movies that portray themselves grounded in reality suddenly become sci-fi
- Big twist isn't really interesting
  - Hugh Jackman thought there was a bigger secret to the trick
- Characters are stupid and make bad decisions
- Sound mixing was too bad
  - Classic Nolan
  - Not a fan of the default royalty free sound effect
  - Every scene has this mystical soundtrack
    - All scenes have the same vibes
      - Hate it
- Another stinker from my boy Nolan

## Tiffany

- Really deep, the message of the story
- Loved it because Trevor hated it
- When David bowie showed up that resonated the most
  - The idea of David Bowie, not as Nikola Tesla
- Later changed answer to not liking it because Berat liked it

## Trevor

- Saw it like 8 years ago
- Hugh Jackman's worst movie
- Maybe any movie with a magician is bad luck for me
- He's doing it for the Prestige, baby!
  - Wouldn't be a Christopher Nolan movie if the title wasn't the movie
