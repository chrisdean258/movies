# Psycho

## Bennett

- Movie could have been a lot shorter
- She turned the water on before she let it get warm
- The part where Hitchcock explains the plot is unnecessary
- Only real character was Norman. others were just plot fodder
- This movie was a real "Bates and switch"
- Didn't particularly like this movie

## Chris

- Bait-and-switch plot
  - Started with plot about theft of 40k
  - Then went on to Norman Bates plot
- Stabbing scene was low key hilariously bad
- Norman terrible liar for having killed several people
- Was not ready for the actual dead body of the mother

## Danielle

- Does a great job of building paranoia 
  - But then that stops at the Bates motel lulling the watcher into a false
    sense of comfort
- Sister and bf were remarkably calm for getting murder explained to them
- Favorite movie by a wide margin
- Particularly enjoyed the soundtrack
  - Best of the "older" movies we've watched
- Norman Bates is the most interesting character we've seen so far

## Hayden

- "I think this Bates guy is on to something"
- Very slow to get to the Bates Hotel
- The iconic shower scene is a twist on the entire movie plot
- Kept expecting woman to be clever about cash but never was
  - Almost goofy with how stupid she was
- Psychiatrist had terrible beside manner
- Thinking about the short story where they poison and taxidermy people
- Liked it more than expected. Not worst or best
  - Would put it on the top 100 list

## Micah

- Good foreshadowing on the premarital pranks
- Least favorite movie so far by a wide margin

## Parker

- Hitchcock was controlling with the information about the movie 
  - To prevent spoilers 
  - Only trailer is Hitchcock going around the movie for 6 minutes not
    revealing things
- Wants explanations like the end scene at the end of movies in other genres
- Enjoyed this one less because he had already seen it alone 6 year ago

## Tiffany

- Fave line: "You eat like a bird"
