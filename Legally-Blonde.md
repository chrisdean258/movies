# Legally Blonde

## Berat

- Didn't realize "youre breaking up with me because I'm too blonde" is from
  this movie
- Second thing with Jennifer Coolidge
  - Interesting throwback to 2 decades ago
- Good
- Luke Wilson looks a lot like Matthew Mercer and its distracting
  - And he was hot so that was also distracting
- She saved the save the day
  - She won the case
  - She got sexually harasses
  - But at the end of the day she girlbossed her way to the top
- Some parts that made me chuckle
  - Boyfriend breaking up then convincing her to get in the car be calling out
    her heals
- Interesting that this movie portrays people caring about cliques and looks a
  lot more than they actually do
- Liked the part where the pool boy answers who his boyfriend is
- Doesn't think Cat cared about the movie
- Loves El's positivity

## Chris

- Best girlboss movie I've seen
- Probably will watch again in the future
- Appreciate the 90 minute runtime
  - Doesn't waste any time

## Danielle

- I can talk
- So this movie is just a good time
- This movie has a lot of influence on barbie movie
- Just a good time
- Not a romcom because the romance is a C plot at most
- Just about a girl girlbossing her way through anything her boyfriend can
  - "What? Like it's hard?"
- Some parts didn't age super well
- Danielle has never gotten a perm
- Bruiser is the best lil guy
  - Well behaved little chihuahua
  - Looks cute in pink
- A lot of characters in this movie
- This movie does pass the Bechdel test
- This movie does pass the reverse bechdel test

## Hannah B

- I love legally blonde
- Girlboss movie 4 sure
- Icon

## Hannah H

- Who is Matt Mercer?
- It slaps
- Least favorite part when watched as a younger lassis getting triked to wear
  the costume to the party
  - But she now girlbosses her way through it
- Loves the court scene
- Like her going to class with a pink macbook with everyone else on boring
  laptops
- Jennifer Coolidge is incredible
  - Not sure she's acting in anything she's in
  - She's just herself
- El is approved
  - And very nice

## Micah

- This movie rocks
  - This movie so good
- Love her character growth
  - Knows what she's about at the start
  - Character growth out of spite
  - She's growing not changing
    - Still leaning into her girlboss attitude
- Biggest dissapointment is the courtroom drama moment
  - It was kind of underwhelming
  - Wanted more girlbossing her way arounf the courtroom
- El is such a positive character
- Likes this movie a lot
