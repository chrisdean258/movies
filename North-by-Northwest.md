# North By Northwest

## Chris

- Fell off in the second half

## Danielle

- Was enjoying myself for the first half, then the second half of the movie
  happened and I wasn't enjoying myself anymore
  - Up to the point we find out the lady is with Van Dam
    - Triple agent craziness
- Should have consequences for showing up to the villian's house
- Liked the "normal guy accused of being a spy" bit
- Why was his mom even there

## Micah 

- I think that it's pretty good
- Still has Hitchcockisms that I don't like
- Cinematography kinda strange
  - Drunk driving scene sped up too much
- Thought the characters were fun
- Though the drunk driving scene and ending chase went on too long
