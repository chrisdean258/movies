# Requiem For A Dream

## Bennett

- Wants to be edgy and sad for the sake of being edgy and bad
- Hated that it make him aware of the culture the movie was created in 
  - Implication the black friend = drugs
- People want to cheer for Harry but he literally starts by stealing his Mom's
  TV

## Chris

- Depravity porn
  - There to make people who don't do drugs feel better about themselves
- Uninteresting story
  - Characters actions feel unmotivated
  - Bad things happen more as karma from drugs than consequences of actions

## Danielle

- Song is an ear worm
- Effect of immediately eating food was cool
- Rest of the movie didn't say anything new and was just depressing
- Maybe was good in 2000 but doesn't hold up
- Despised the spinning camera effect
- Did pass the Bechdel test

## Micah

- Dumb
- Kind of depravity for the sake of depravity
- No character motivations
- Surface level metaphor for prescription drugs can be bad too
- The drug sequences were interesting
- Staff at hospital stopped seeing patients as human
  - Interesting take
- Song was only in the movie to force emotion because the movie lacked emotion
- Liked the mom in slow motion while Dr. Was in fast motion

## Tiffany

- Didn't finish movie but also probably agrees with Micah
- Though the drug doing scene was overused
- Characters are just "people who do drugs"
