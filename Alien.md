# Alien

## Bennett

- Confused about the android power source
  - White milky fluid
- Some of the overacting adds to the charm of the movies

## Chris

- One of my favorite horror films
- Glad the cat lives
- Ripley is a good protagonist
- Probably A tier

## Danielle

- Thinks that Micah thinks Alien is pretty sick
- Employer just called "The Company" the entire time
- Love how anti-capitalism this company is
- Physical acting could use some work in places
- Solid movie
- Probably A tier
- Probably a pro cat film
- Baby alien scuttling away is hilarious
- Parker hitting android's head is peak comedy

## Micah

- Only problems are inherent to the horror genre
  - Sometimes feels like a waste of time
- Suffers from "everyone is an idiot except me"
- Face hugger + acid blood is cool
- One dude an android plot twist was unexpected
- Don't like trying to make the end sexy with Ripley in underwear
- Apparently the people in the starship were supposed to be more sex on the space ship
- B Tier all the way through

## Parker

- Hollywood just backing sci-fi movies after star wars
- Just too slow in the first part
  - Not slow and suspenseful just slow
- Random surprise of corporate spy android
  - Works against the problem of every person being incompetent


# Aliens

## Chris

- This movie is just the same as the previous one just kinda worse
- Power scaling issues in this one, aliens a lot less powerful
- This movie is less motivated by corporate greed an more by individual
  evilness and greed
- Loaders are sick but James Cameron Overuses them

## Danielle

- Definitely a James Cameron not a Ridley Scott
  - Long runtime
- Appreciated the Jones lived and they payed homage
- Didn't like that Ripley smoked now
- Last time it was a cat, this time it was a child
  - That's probably why Alien was better
- Marines are dumb
- JK Rowling plagiarising "Stay away from here you bitch"
- Passes the hell out of the Bechdel test

## Micah

- Thinks the Danielle probably didn't like this one as much
  - Because not a lot happens and marines are dumb
  - But had a lot of fun in the last hour
- C or D tier in the first half, A in the last half
- Marines dumb and unlikeable
- Not a lot happens, then they find the nest and all die
- Basically slow then fast
- Has a more emotional story than previous one
  - With Ripley losing her daughter to time then getting a "new one"
- Plot twist less unexpected
- Last scene with Ripley in the loader is fun
- Guy immediately grabs cigar after cryo-sleep

## Parker

- Don't think the marines are as bad as everyone else thinks
- Basically action heroes from other stuff
  - But immediately die when they meet the alien
- Favorite part is the very end when Ripley is extracting herself and newt from
  the nest threatening with the flamethrower and an "agreement" is reached with
  the queen
  - Then the queen sicks the alien on her from behind
  - And Ripley wins then takes the time to burn the eggs while a nuke is on
    countdown
