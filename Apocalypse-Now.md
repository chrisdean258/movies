# Apocalypse Now

## Chris

- It's a war movie
- Kinda went off the rails at the end
- Narration made it feel like reading a book
- Fairly episodic
  - Things start, happen, and end and then the next thing starts

## Danielle

- Didn't like this movie
- From the beginning didn't think this movie was for her
- Didn't understand the opening sequence
  - Never paid off
- Voiceover was weird
  - Jarring to have him come in at random times
- The two scenes I was like "why is this here"
  - Only in the extended cut
  - Both of them showed boobs
- Succeeded in me not caring about it but also making me sad
  - Harshed the mellow
  - I don't understand people who want to watch war movies
- Didn't like that the entire mission was to go assassinnate this man
  - Took 2 and a half hours to get there
- Does not pass the bechdel test

## Micah

- Found out about the halfway through the movie that there are two cuts of the movie and lost interest
- Beginning tried to be funny in a dark way
- Didn't vibe with the characters
  - Captain guy obsessed with the surfer
  - Captain of the boat
  - Guy who shot puppy lady
- Why did any of this matter
  - Playboy thing
  - Bridge place
    - Why does this matter
    - Who are all the characters
  - Etc
- Only watched half. Probably won't finish
- Seemed like some of the characters were enjoying the war crimes
