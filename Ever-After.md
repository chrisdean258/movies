# Ever After

## Chris

- Basically what Micah said
- Would rather just watch The Princess Bride
  - But Micah did say that too

## Danielle

- It's a fun movie
- Cinderella retelling
  - Maybe a bit overdone
- Refreshing take on a cinderalla story
- Like this movie but it fell short
- Chemistry between the main characters was lacking
- Other movies did it better
- Great one liners
- Forgot that leonardo da vinci was a character
- Does pass the Bechdel Test

## Micah

- Didn't know what he was getting into
- Thought it would be a cinderella comedy
- "Taking anything she can carry" moment
  - Very funny
- Sets were very good
- Like a fictional movie with realy world characters
  - Da Vinci
- Agree with lack of chemistry between main characters
  - Henry actor good
  - Drew Barrymore kinda eh
    - Why she shake her head like that

## Hannah

- Huge rush of cinderella takes around this time
  - Ella Enchanted kinda pops off
- Does a good job of making you care about other things than the main
  Cinderella plotline
