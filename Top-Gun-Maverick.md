# Top Gun: Maverick

## Bennett

- Rooster goes to talk to Mav and Mav says I'll tell you something important
  - And then I predicted the rest of the movie
- Thought Bob was going to die
- Romance subplot matters exactly 0

## Chris

- Movie was absolute garbage
- All my homies hate Miles Teller
- Plane stuff is fun to watch

## Danielle

- Was angry Mav survived ejecting at MACH 10
- This movie did pass the Bechdel test technically
- Every time they were next to each other it was clear how much shorter Tom
  Cruise was then Miles Teller

## Hannah

- Funniest thing: Trying to figure out what plane to take on the mission
  - Most convoluted reason for using old planes
  - No way in hell the the Navy would lend an F22
- You can definitely take off from a taxiway
  - Harrison Ford landed on a taxiway

## Micah

- Fine
- Airplanes are cool
- Most predicatable movie of my life
- Hated the test flight part
- All pilot students have exactly one generic character trop

## Parker

- Vroom, shh, vroom, shh AMERICA
- Plane ejection at MACH 9 was unbelievable
- Biggest difference in quality of seeing at theater vs home
- Cut the movie. Only include the plane parts for a better movie
- Least favorite twist was failing the targetting with the targetting laser
