# Inception

## Chris

- Ok movie
- Good heist movie with good actions
- Characters are really bad

## Danielle

- All Christopher Nolan movies like to be real thinky
- Visually great
  - Nice and attractive to watch
- Characters suck
  - Only character with any insight is Dom
  - Ariadne is just the audience
  - The rest of the characters are just heist participants
- Limbo makes me angry
- Movie is too long
- Starts off with guys doing morally gray stuff
  - Soto asks for them to cheat
  - And then somehow they become the good guys

## Hannah

- Either watched the first 40 minutes of The Matrix or Inception 10 years ago

## Micah

- Really like the Dream Heist
- Likes the effects and the effects of the universe
- People's dreams in this movie not nearly as funny as mine
- Christopher Nolan likes to make pretentious movies 
  - Whose plots needs to be explains
- Keep introducing characters
- Every line is exposition
- Limbo is dumb
  - I guess it makes stakes
- Action sequences were great

## Parker

- Watching Inception alone in the dark on a Tuesday is alot less sad the Roman
  Holiday on Valentine's Day
- Liked this movie more than the rest of us
- Was hoping for more of a payoff with Arthur's character
- Wish the enemy in the heist were more realized
- Only big problem is whether or not the top keeps spinning
