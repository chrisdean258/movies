# Hara-kiri

## Chris

- "This was a depressing movie"
- A lot of anti-samurai propaganda
- First half was almost mind numbingly boring
- Would have loved to see this in color

## Danielle

- Movie was too long
- Everything was so drawn out

## Micah

- This is my favorite movie so far
- Peaked my curiosity
- Was about the character of the main character not about a message
  - Don't care about the samurai code, just the drawn out story telling
  - But also they're just going to cover it up
- Final fight sequence was far from convincing
- Some of the best cinematography
