# Toy Story 1 & 3

## Movie Impressions

- Yeah, it's a good series.
- The improvements in animation between the movies are wild.
- Woody kind of sucks.

## Chris

## Danielle
- Danielle thinks Tony Stark is hot.
- "I don't think Toy Story lived up to my expectations, and Toy Story 3 is overrated because it has one very poignant moment."

## Hannah
- Hannah thinks Toy Story's animation is rough and looks like old VeggieTales.
- "I really like all the side charaters in the Toy Stories. They're all just like vibing."

## Hayden
- "It's... good"
- "I would take my 6 year old to see Toy Story. I wouldn't take my 6 year old to go see M."
- "Toy Story - that's a Citizen Kane."

## Micah
- Toy Story had charm because it played into the characters being toys, not so much Toy Story 3.
"Toy Story is good."

## Parker
- Toy Story has some interesting horror elements


We spent the entire time talking about Toy Story and Toy Story 3, zero time talking about Toy Story 2 because that wasn't part of this.
Each of us rewatched both of these movies beforehand and were not relying on childhood memories.
