"I would take my 6 year old to see Toy Story. I wouldn't take my 6 year old to go see M."
-Hayden

Micah says Toy Story had charm because it played into the characters being toys, not so much Toy Story 3.

Danielle thinks Tony Stark is hot.

Hannah thinks Toy Story's animation is rough and looks like old VeggieTales.

We spent the entire time talking about Toy Story and Toy Story 3, zero time talking about Toy Story 2 because that wasn't part of this.
Each of us rewatched both of these movies beforehand and were not relying on childhood memories.
