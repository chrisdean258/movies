# Evil Dead II

## Bennett

- "Has some pretty funny moments but not a movie I would ever watch alone"
- Significant improvement over the first one
- Disappointed Ash was never thrown into any bookshelves
- Best joke is cutting off his arm and putting it under the book "A Farewell to Arms"

## Chris

- Had seen "Army of Darkness" and "Ash vs Evil Dead" but not this movie

## Danielle

- Maniacal laughter and going ew..ew..ew
- This movie was goofy. Not a lot beyond that

## Hayden

- Running gag of all the camera men running out of the forest
- Was satisfied with his selection
- Hard to compare this movie to the other because not top 100
  - And also watching in a group
- But this was his favorite "viewing" 
- Special effects were better in the third one
- Over the top..completely ridiculous
- Liked the giant demon puppet at the end
  - Definitely better as a physical prop than CGI

## Micah

- Favorite part was watching it with Parker and hearing him work the title into quotes

## Parker

- Largest delta over the first one...and the second one was still bad
- Still had a really good time
- Change Ash from a character getting developed to a character that said "Groovy"
- Thinks Hayden likes hanging out with his friends
- The first movie improved the quality of the second one
