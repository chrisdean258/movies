## Chris

- Liked the movie more than expected
- Looked very nice
- Didn't really get it like not for me
- But did enjoy the quirky vibes
- Foreign movies are hard 
  - Subtitle :thumbs_down:

## Danielle

- Liked this move
- Didn't have high expectations for the movie
- Weird in a way I could vibe with
- Intro had me immediately
- Liked the plot lines
  - The gnome travelling
  - Messing with the mean shopkeeper
    - He gonna need help tho
- Did not care a ton for the cafe setup
  - Creepy guy who needs a restraining order + hypochondriac
    - Not good
- Not a fan of the romantic plot
  - Shy girl pining after someone
  - But did like the side quest with the photo booth
- This film had me chuckling quite a bit
- Didn't mind the subtitles too much
- This movie passed the Bechdel test
- Would watch again

## Micah

- Watched an alternate version
  - Day after suggested watched the first 20 minutes in a dream
    - First 10 minutes was old guys critiquing  video game soundtrack
    - Then Amélie came and that was cool
- Liked the quippy opening 
  - Heartbeat thing
  - Goldfish scene was sad
  - Quippy narrator was good
- Character motivations didn't do anything for me
- Goofy quests with goofy conclusions fit the movie
  - But doesn't do a whole lot for me
- Use of color was good
- Directorial style was fun
  - Cinematography
  - 4th wall break
- Foreign movies are hard
