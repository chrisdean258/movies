## Danielle

- Probably the best Nolan film so far
- Liked he wasn't a good guy in the end
- Very cool film structure - can't really do it again
- Even though this movie is less guilty of it - it's still pretty easy to poke holes in the ideas if you just think about it for a sec
- Did not pass the Bechdel test

## Micah

- Agreed best Nolan film so far
- Liked the structure, didn't need to be bottle fed everything
- Still felt like it was necessary to Google an explanation of the ending
- Liked some of the plot twist but not all
- Agreed that holes are easily poked in Nolan films
