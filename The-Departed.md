## Chris

- Timelines in this movie were fairly understandable
- Big fan of everyone dying
- Kind of surprised that this wasn't a horror movie
  - The Departed
- Loved Jack Nicholson's characters

## Danielle

- Very watchable movie, casual bigotry aside
- Intro was weird
  - Jack Nicholson talking about race riots
  - Not really relevant
- Little long for my taste
  - But I don't know what I would have cut
- Didn't love it
  - Not the worst of the movies
  - B tier film
- Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson good acting
  - Leo Dicaprio not so much
- Not a great portrait of psychologists
  - Why did she like Leo's character
- Did not pass the Bechdel test
- Kinda dug everyone dying

## Micah

- Cool concept here but definitely written with early 2000s casual bigotry
  - The way women are portrayed is god awful
  - White people saying the n word -- yikes
- Enjoyed the concept
- Good lead acting
- Cool concept
- Fan of the actors
  - Matt Damon
- Well executed
- Liked the twists
  - Dudes said the wrong address
- When Leo Dicaprio's character is talking to Matt Damon's character 
  - Cool tension
- Lots of people die in the end
  - Cool but not satisfying
- Big eye rolls of the sex scenes
- Based off a 2002 Hong Kong Movie, Internal Affairs 2002
  - Brad Pitt purchased rights and made it for a western audience
  - Original producer thought The Departed is too vulgar and focused on violence
