# Its A Wonderful Life

## Bennett

- Liked the part where the true meaning of Xmas was the friends we made along
  the way

## Chris

- Wonderful movie

## Danielle

- Likes it better every time she sees it
- George kinda yells at everyone
  - But that was just what acting was in the story
- Likes the story
  - Reminiscent of "A Christmas Carol"

## Hannah

- Interesting to see the O.G. what life would be like if I didn't exist
- Added to the list of Xmas movies to watch
- A little too long
- Surprisingly anti-capitalist

## Micah

- Some scenes made uncomfortable
  - People accept too much domestic violence
  - Yikes on the clothes scene
- Should have had a "mid" actor for George Bailey
- Other than those problems this movie bangs
  - Huge fan
- Humor was on point
  - Swimming pool scene
  - Funny drunk uncle Billy
- Presentation of heaven and god was charming
- The "George didn't exist timeline" everything came back around
