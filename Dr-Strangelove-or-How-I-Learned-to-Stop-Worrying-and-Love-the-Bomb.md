# Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb


## Chris

- Was boring at first but then it got better
- Really liked the guy riding the bomb on the way down
- Good that everyone died

## Danielle

- Thought it was boring for awhile
- Really enjoyed the you can't fight in here - it's the war room quote
- Things picked up once it became clear that plane was probably going to drop the bomb
- The guy riding the bomb to his death was pretty yeehaw
- Sillier than expected
- Did not pass the Bechdel test (like not even a lil bit)

## Micah

- Kind of liked it
- First bit of it was kind of boring with everyone just being confused about what code R was
- Then it got fun when the war room meeting started happening
- Just a lil goofy

## Parker

- Watched this like maybe 8 years ago
- Not good but understands its value
- Unlike *some* movies we have seen
- Favorite quote: "Gentlemen! You can't fight in here. This is the war room!"
