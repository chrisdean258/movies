# Vertigo

## Chris

- Liked the first two acts were good but should have ended a lot darker
- Needed Jimmy Stewart's character to be either a murderer catatonic by the end

## Danielle

- I didn't dislike the movie
- It's aight
- Premise was kind of interesting
- Probably would watch again
- Vertigo pays off..then there's a whole extra act
- Not a fan of the third act
- Ending was real goofy
  - I get it they couldn't have a happy relationship
    - No chemistry
  - He was insane. She helped someone murder there wife
  - And they dropped Midge
    - Midge was fun
    - Not a fan of the romantic tension with John/Scottie
- Interesting takes
- Maybe doing a remake
- So many shots of people in cars that aren't actually driving
- Did not pass the Bechdel test

## Micah

- Vertigo blows
- Didn't like it at all
- The main love plot came out of nowhere
  - Didn't get the kiss out of nowhere
- Weird in the second half
- Didn't appreciate the tone shit out of nowhere
- Not a fan of Hitchcock
  - All the actors are so stiff and don't talk like people
- So much filler
  - This movie could be 40 minutes long
- Camera effects don't hold up in 2023
- Unnatural dialogue and interactions
