# Toy Story 1 & 3

## Movie Impressions

- Yeah, it's a good series.

- The improvements in animation between the movies are wild.

- Parker has interesting thoughts about the horror elements of the movies.

- Woody kind of sucks.

## Final Thoughts

- Hayden - "Toy Story - that's a Citizen Kane."
- Hannah - "I really like all the side characters in the Toy Stories. They're all just like vibing."
- Micah - "Toy Story is good."
- Danielle - "I don't think Toy Story lived up to my expectations, and Toy Story 3 is overrated because it has a very poignant moment."
