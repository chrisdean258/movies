# Singin In The Rain

## Bennett

- This is the movie a lot of people think of when people think of musicals
  - In a good and bad way
- Lots of bops and good choreography
  - Very impressive choreography
- Story only exists to tie together the musical bits
- Lots of one shot scenes in the choreography
- Got tiered by the end
- Liked the police officer who looked like he was going to arrest him for being
  too happy

## Chris

- Now I've seen singing in the Rain
- Very much agree with Micah

## Danielle

- Last musical number too long
- Had a great time
  - Except car scene
  - And black face in the background
- Aged decently well
- "Make them laugh" so impressive

## Micah

- Musicals don't really do anything for me
- Liked Cosmo and Kathy
  - Silly little friends
- Only two scene made me uncomfortable
  - Car scene
  - 16 and kissable
  - Other than that big plus
- A couple bops
  - Fit as a fiddle
- Choreography was fun
  - Modern intro for the movie
- It's fine
- "Make them laugh"
  - Liked the part where he couldn't stand up
- How about that "I'm going to kill myself joke" in the first 10 minutes
