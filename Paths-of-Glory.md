# Paths Of Glory

## Becky

- Really liked it as a commentary but was uncomfortable watching it
- Took the entire movie to understand the beginning of the movie
- Court scene brought the "two wars" together
  - WWI and the political war of the higher ups
- Most impactful scene:
  - The guy collapses in fear
    - Gets asked how he wants to be remembered

## Danielle

- This movie is more of a courtroom drama than a war movie
- Stark contrast between the lives of the generals and the soldiers
- Cinematography:
  - Good shot of the general walking along the trenches
  - The flares going up and lighting up all the dead bodies in no man's land
- Its a very hard movie to watch
  - Not rewatchable
    - But deserving of a spot on the top 100 list (Becky)

## Chris

- Was not expecting an anti war film
- The way that the generals talked about lives of their men was abhorrent
  - In the percentages of dead men
  - And talking about how the executions were good for morale

## Hayden

- Liked it but is an "emotional masochist"
  - Was uncomfortable
- Pvt. Maurice 
  - Actor was fired and super disruptive
- At the beginning "Gen. Paul" says he cares for every man
  - But at the end "you're men died splendidly" 
- Gen. Paul has a uppity grandiose ideal of war and running is ruing it
- Abuse of power and hierarchy on 3 levels
  - George v Paul
  - Paul vs Dax
  - Officer who threw grenade vs the soldier executed
  - How can an army like this even function?
- Last scene was a flip of tone
  - Went from a presumably dirty scene to the singing human moment
