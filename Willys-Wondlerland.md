# Willy's Wonderland

## Becky

- Made her take notes because it was bad
- Sexual energy from the pinball machine
- The background made the movie worse
- "You're as hot as a pancake on a grill and just as yummy"
- Got mad when everything got dirty and janitor had to re-clean everything
- "Hey Micah, what the heck"

## Bennett

- Only the sinful children get murdered
- What was the deal with the soda?
- Favorite scene: When Nicholas Cage just leaves cause its break time
- Movie was bad so he enjoyed scenes when Nicholas Cage was on screen

## Chris

- Does Chuck E Cheese's kill children?
- How about Liv's adoptive mom handcuffing her in a trailer
  - She dies due to low moral character - Micah

## Danielle

- Don't clean because a murderer might mess it up
- Can I get that miracle cleaner
- Liv fought off sombrero guy tho...

## Hayden

- On the sex scene with the ball pit/fun room: "There were two sex scenes going
  on"
- Felt like they shot the scenes without knowing what order they were going in
- They were setting up the cinematic universe
- It's implied the children knew the animatronics were evil but they get inside
  and completely forget it
- Liv had no job but to stand around emotionlessly
  - She shows up, doesn't say anything, and gets into a car with an old guy
- Motion sick from the post processing

## Micah

- "If you smoke weed or have sex then you die"
- The movie gaslights you into thinking parts of it are good

## Parker

- Head cannon: Janitor stopped at a gas station and got more soda
- Last scene was a lazy car explosion to kill bad guys
- Liv stays pure, thus is able to survive to the end
- In need of an epilepsy warning
- "That was a movie or my name isn't Tex McAdoo"

## Tiffany

- Willy's Wonderland is an Oscar worth movie and criticism will not be tolerated
