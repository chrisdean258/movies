# There Will Be Blood

## Bennett

- Not a fan of grimdark settings
- Not here for the bad man becomes sadder vibes
- Problems at the beginning lead to tragic downfall
  - And I hate him

## Chris

- Interesting character dynamics between Daniel, Eli
  - Power transfer between church and wealth
- Look at a character going into madness/depression

## Danielle

- I did not like this movie
- Did not pass the Bechdel test
- Wants to enjoy watching movies
  - Needs some escapism
- Didn't like the sound effects for bad things happening
- Way too slow
  - People (except Daniel) talked too slow
- Issue was not any individual scenes but just the whole thing

## Micah

- This movie is an interesting use of the medium
- The cinematography and acting are stellar
- What's the point
  - Just kind of watching this man decent into madness
- Didn't really work for me
  - Care more about outcomes and progression
- Confused at the end because sun grew up but preacher didn't
