# The Lives Of Others

## Chris

- Yeah its fine. Rather wouldn't have watched it
- Truck scene was a but comic


## Danielle

- Why on the top 100?
- Havent seen another cold war germany movie
- Would have been a better book
- Not there for the tension
  - Too far removed
  - Will they make the phone call scene
- Didn't believe the Stasi agent would change his ways because he saw two
  people in love
- Instead of watching a movie, more like reading information
- Did not pass the bechdel test

## Micah

- Didn't pay great attention to the first part of the movie
- Well acted
- Nice looking movie
- Not great visual story telling
  - Not necessarily against the film, just enjoyment of it
