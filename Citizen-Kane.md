# Citizen Kane

## Chris

- Elon Musk..in the 1940s
- I'm glad I watched it so I can tell people they don't need to watch it
- Very boring. 
- Rich people doing rich people things and complaining their life is bad

## Danielle

- It has previously been discussed about how movies that wrap up the movie by
  an actor explaining everything that just happened in the movie is bad. I have
  reason to disagree with this statement, but I'll hold back in order to posit
  a new bad trope: revealing the whole plot of the movie at the very beginning
  and then spending the rest of the movie just acting out what was already
  revealed in the opening of the movie.

- I am so, so, so disappointed by this movie. I thought it was really boring,
  and I was uninterested in all of the characters.

- The whole Rosebud mystery just was not interesting to me, but perhaps that's
  because I came into the movie already knowing what Rosebud was. I still
  believe that it does not add anything to the movie. I think I would feel the
  exact same about the movie had they never revealed what Rosebud was. It just
  didn't add anything. Perhaps there is an interesting discussion in why he
  would have said Rosebud as his last words, but I don't think the movie did a
  good job of exploring that.

- Also, it needs to be said that I have a completely untrained ear to music. I
  truly did not know Susan was singing poorly in the practice scenes.

- Does not pass the Bechdel test.

## Hayden

- Didn't know what to expect with this movie
  - Was expecting a Casablanca type movie
- Overall pretty good
  - Long
  - Early on could be disengaging
- After halfway through found it more engaging
- Liked the parrot jump-scare
- Can see why people compare movies to this
- For its time period was very well put together
  - I.e. sets and costumes
- Enjoyed the people talking over one another

## Micah

- Movie sucks. Didn't like it at all
- Can see how it may have been innovative at the time
- Didn't care about Charles Kane
- No benefit from the flashbacks
- People don't shut up in this movie
  - Too much to process
  - Repeating the same thing too many times
- First ten minutes just laughing at the movie
- Liked the scene with the governor's speech
- Every character is a white guy in a suit

## Parker

- Incredibly uninteresting as a movie
- When other people say its no citizen Kane
  - They're talking about risks with camera angles, innovation
- Uninteresting as a movie
- By far the best thing: If someone says they like this movie you know what
  type of movie discussion they want to have and can avoid it
