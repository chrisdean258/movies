# America History X

## Becky

- Culturally relevant but hard to watch
- Ending didn't make sense
- Left with a feeling of futility
- Enjoyed the framing of the movie in the paper for history class
- Liked the basketball scene was the most "real" feeling
  - Daily life type of racism
- Would have liked to show more reformed Derek with less violent necessities
- Costuming were so specifically designed to show a certain type of character
  its funny
  - Very stereotypical

## Chris

- Really enjoying how not racist they were
- Really fell into the trope of "savior black person"
- Did not enjoy the long flashback
- Would have liked to see the mother show that people are still humans
- Also would have liked to see more of a representation of debunking racist
  rhetoric
- Edward Norton acting was phenomenal
  - The look of self righteousness when he curb stomps that guy

## Danielle

- Hated it
- Worst movie ever
- Did not do a good job of displaying the way people get caught into the alt
  right pipeline
- Hated the basketball scene
- No nuance extended to non white characters
- Timeline didn't make sense. 3 years not enough

## Micah

- Thought the older brother would get shot
- Good role model break the cycle of group-think
- "Even if you reform your ways, there will still be consequences to your past
  actions"
- Would liked to have seen more backstory
- Derek's change in personality not really justified
- Really enjoyed the telling of the story through flashback
  - Builds curiosity about a character without revealing all the things about
    them
- Could have had a longer runtime
- Really enjoyed the basketball scene
  - Musical themes and portrayal of "victory"
- Didn't like the portrayal of the black guy in jail
  - The principal had a lot of implied nuance
- That tie was way too short
