# Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind

## Chris

- How did they come up with this idea and it ended the worst and least
  interesting way
- Did not stick the landing

## Danielle

- So close to being a movie i really like but missed it
- Concept of meeting a character exclsively through memories is interesting
- Only know Joel's perception of Clemintine
  - Neither Joel nor Clemintine is mentally well
- Reverse chronological order of relationship is interesting
  - Different feeling of Clemintine at the end than beginning
- No likable characters

## Hannah

- Top 4 letterbox review
  - "This also happened when I dyed my hair"
  - "My favorite genre of film: pain"
  - "Love is dead. happy valentines day"

## Micah

- Hoped I would like it based on the opening scene
- Thought the acting was good between Jim Cary and Kate Winslet
- Thought it would be another Jim Cary banger
- Didn't care for it after the opening scene
- Not a fan of "what if we had this fundamentally ethically questionable tech"
- Not a fan of early 2000s media
- Casual bigotry - not a fan
- Didn't like the characters
  - Whiny and annoying and dumb
