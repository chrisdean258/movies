# A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood


## Chris

- Liked Tom Hank's Mr. Rogers
- Wanted more of a movie about Mr. Rogers
- Kinda boring
- Didn't like the main character
  - Specifically had no reason to cheer for him

## Danielle

- Nice
- Didn't watch a ton of Mr. Rogers as a child but still had nostalgia
- Heartwarming story
- Stark lack of drugs ... pretty cool
- Tom Hanks did a good job of embodying Mr. Rogers
- From a technical standpoint this movie felt like a TV show
- Couldn't figure out the main character's living situation
- Did not pass the Bechdel test

## Micah

- Picked this move because whenever we watched Good Will Hunting this movie
  does a lot better
- Thought was a good example of a guy overcoming issues he has with his past
- Liked Tom Hank's Mr. Rogers
- Liked the transitions in Mr. Roger's style
- Bad character writing at times
  - E.g. wife inviting father into apartment
- Heart attack at the good time was trope-y
- Passes out on set and is taken to ... Mr. Roger's house?
- Entire subway car singing is kinda trope-y

## Parker

- Mr. Rogers absolute banger of a human being
- Highly recommend anyone who is Mr. Rogers
- Favorite part of the theme song is the very beginning
