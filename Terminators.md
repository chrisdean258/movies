# The Terminator

## Bennett

- Really cool because time travel
  - Makes sense
  - Things in the past always happen
- If AI is so intelligent then why did they send things to the past knowing it
  wouldn't change anything?
  - Maybe they have to
- Stop motion action at the end is sick
  - Other worldly ghostlike quality

## Chris

- Enjoyed it but it wasn't earth shattering

## Danielle

- Though this movie was very watchable
- Don't think it will stick around too long
- Interesting that this is a time travel movie that doesn't make you think
  about it too much
- Liked Sarah Conner despite her only being important for her son
  - She kinda handles being kidnapped normally
    - Bites Reese's hand, etc
- Effects are corn but endearing
  - Arnold's half melted face
- Liked comparison to this as a horror movie
  - Sleep in the woods
  - Hotel room
- This movie passed the Bechdel test

## Micah

- Liked this movie a lot more than expected
- Throws us into a scenario with 3 established characters
  - But doesn't tell us all about them
  - Better story telling
  - very intriguing with the story drip feed
- Arnold is a very cool villain
  - Police station scene shows how unstoppable he is
  - Copying a police officer voice early then called back later with Sarah's
    mother's voice
- Reasonable for Sarah to be attached to Reese
  - Saving her life and whatnot
  - Why is Reese in love with a Polaroid
  - Could have played it out a bit more
- Liked the foreshadowing to attract the terminator with the hydraulic press
- I have no idea what Chris thinks about this movie

## Parker

- Scene that stands out is the terminator massacring everyone in the police station
  - Is this where they got infinite spawner mechanics in video games?
- Eh its fine
  - How bad were movies before this for this to be groundbreaking
  - Normal action sci-fi that's old

# Terminator II: Judgement Day

## Bennett

- Watched it when I was young - hadn't seen The Terminator 
- Thought liquid metal terminator was really cool
  - In middle school
- Confuses this movie with "The Butterfly effect"
- In Terminator I time travel isn't real, in this one it is
  - And it's better for time travel to be fake
- Terminator being a good guy is a good plot twist
  - Except when you are a kid and only know Schwarzenegger so he has to be good
- Fights are cool
- Just an action movie
- Kinda dumb
- Characters are all turned up to 10 in this one
- Likes the Horror movie tone more
- Similar to Infinity War to End Game

## Chris

- Just the first movie
- Not a fan of the CGI
- Not a fan of the child actor
  - Made him a little shit and maybe ruined the series through it
- Its fun but doesn't super hold up to scrutiny

## Danielle

- This movie, its just not as good because its the same movie but longer
  - Didn't like it
  - Just made it longer
- Might have liked it more if hadn't just watched the first one
  - Maybe less bored at times
- Parts were interesting
  - Breakout from the psych ward
  - Confrontation with new good terminator
- Did not care for John Conner
- Didn't love the plot to stopping the AI war by gunning down poor hapless programmer
  - And then they just tried to help him
  - Brought too much attn to the time travel
  - Also didn't matter to destroy the tech because the terminator lost an arm
- Did not pass the Bechdel test

## Micah

- Scene talking to the terminator at the foster parents home
- Sarah's character is much more interesting in this one
  - Breaking out of the mental hospital p cool
- Though the CPU guy could be a likable character in the future
- Though the CGI was impressive for just a 7 year gap
- Already knew about the characters
  - Sarah went from bad ass to deranged
  - Schwarzenegger's becoming more understanding of human OK
  - John Conner insufferable the entire movie
    - Not likeable character or actor
- Didn't think the final scene of Schwarzenegger's terminator determining
  between real and fake Sarah - not foreshadowed
- Back to back similar movies - maybe better with a gap
- Much more of an action movie than horror 
- Little plot things
  - Wasn't this supposed to be last resort the AI
  - Can you change the future or not? Destroying the chips
- Don't like the bad terminator not being in a middle hour of the movie
- Why don't questions get asked about Schwarzenegger showing up and killing
  police dept

## Parker

- Danielle has free will
- I liked the car chase in the canal scene
- Really liked Robert Patrick non CGI being a scary monster 
  - While running looked like not breathing or blinking
- The way they decided to make this movie
  - Why did they make the characters I cared about in this movie same as the others
  - Sarah and Arnold Terminator
- Think this movie is kinda good
  - But there isn't anywhere else to go with the characters
- This movie brought the plot and background story to the forefront in a bad way
