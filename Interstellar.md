# Interstellar

## Chris

- Cinematography was pretty good in this movie
- The beginning framing as a documentary was cool
- Tried to fix not a time travel movie with time travel
- Absolutely terrible group of people to be astronauts
- They really try to play up love as something it isn't

## Danielle

- Juxtaposition between the dust bowl and advanced technology
- Funny that everyone was moon landing deniers at the school
- Agrees with Micah for once
- Issues with time travel movies
- Volume issues between sound effects and dialogue
- Christopher Nolan's films are overhyped and try to make you feel smarter than
  the movie is
- Matt Damon's entire character is entirely inconsequential
- Didn't remember Anne Hathaway's character being so unlikeable
- Why was Anne Hathaway's Character so obsessed with getting the data on water
  world?
- Michael Caine twist wasn't interesting
- Tom was clearly the lest favorite child

## Hayden

- Liked the soundtrack
- Really liked the first half (world they set up), but it changes as they went
  with it
  - Unmanned drones people have lost control over
  - NASA stuff, not star trek
- Liked the robots
  - Practical effects
  - Monotone,calm voices like HAL
- Rendering for the black hole was one of the most technologically accurate for
  the time
  - Every frame of the black hole took ~100 hrs to render
  - 800 terabytes total of data

## Micah

- Both pre and peri-apocalyptic setting is pretty cool
- Conflicting thoughts on this move
- Best looking movie we've seen so far
- Good soundtrack/cinematography
- Doesn't like how McConaughey's character is written
  - Every line is a one liner
- This movie is very pretentious
  - Likes to make you feel smart without being smart
- Doesn't like ambiguity in world building
  - The "They", the 5th dimensional ancestors of humans "not" changing the past
- Major case of everyone's an idiot except me
- The conflict of resource management was so interesting but the other
  conflicts weren't
- Etreme in what makes it good and bad leaves it in the middle of the pack

## Parker

- Soundtrack was very majestic
  - Not inspiring to actually watch the movie
