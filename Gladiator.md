# Gladiator

## Danielle

- Not really interested in this genre of movie
- Movie would be better if it was not told in linear fashion, immediately let audience know this is a revenge film and cut so much of the excrutiatingly long intro
- Not a fan of Russell Crowe's acting, felt boring and one-note
- Revenge and gore porn
- Did like that he died in the end
- Did not pass the Bechdel test

## Micah

- Exceeded expectations
- First hour boring though
- Pretty basic
- Satisfying ending
- Hates the cinematography
- HATES INCEST
- Resounding fine

## Parker

- Have to read a movie? No thanks
