# In A Lonely Place

## Bennett

- That girl needs to get away from Dixon
  - He was gonna kill her for leaving him
- Title doesn't make sense
- Kept predicting a twist
  - And kept being disappointed
- Didn't have any problem with pacing of this movie
  - Also watched this at 1.5x speed

## Chris

- I enjoyed the movie but it was confusing and the characters had weird
  motivations
- For being a murder mystery this movie was a lot about domestic abuse and not
  the murder that happened
- Constantly smoking

## Danielle

- This was a different time
  - She really just went home with that guy
- Also with Laurel, he was very clearly controlling and big yikes
  - Sleeping pills etc
  - Laurel didn't pick up on all the red flags
- Sylvia
  - "I'm glad you're not a genius"
  - "I like my men attractive and average"

## Micah

- As a whole this movie was good but unsatisfying
  - No problems with the plot but nothing mattered
  - Just not a murder mystery
    - OK..I guess he's not a killer just a jackass
- Problems with old movies
  - People talk unlike any real person
    - Opening scene convincing the girl to come to his house
  - Any sort of action looks bad
    - Not as much of a problem in this movie

## Parker

- I only liked the movie because I've read the book before
- Movie pranked me and was nothing like the book
- Movie was so different thought the intro was going to lead into the reading
  of the actual movie
  - At one point this was my favorite book
  - Dixon wasn't as misogynistic as in the movie
  - First woman wasn't in the book
  - The two women were the characters that actually had agency
    - Sylvia actually does all the work in the books
  - He is the murderer in the book
    - Pranked
    - Doesn't say he killed her
  - Learning the protagonist is the murder is the interesting thing about the
    book
- Very surprised when it turns out he wasn't the murderer
- In the movie Dixon isn't as much misogynistic as misanthropic
  - In the book its more pointed towards women
  - Parker's favorite book by the way
- The lonely place is where Dixon murders people
- Also he's not a successful author in the book and is scamming his uncle for
  money
