# Avengers: Infinity War

## Bennett

- Chris Pratt is the equivalent of Jaune in RWBY.
- Thanos had a stupid motive
  - What is he going to do this every few years

## Berat

- Used Chris Pratt as catalyst to mean they couldn't win
  - Also used his jealousy of Thor as haha funny rather than actually making
    him a funny character
- Thought the making of the axe didn't fit the pacing of the rest of the movie 
  - Seemed unnecessary

## Chris

- Did everyone have really bad IBS after the snap?
- Good pacing. Not too much or too little of any characters

## Danielle

- Star Lord fucks everything up
  - Insecure man-child
- Didn't love the series of events leading up to the final battle but liked the
  final battle
- Scar Jo and Mark Ruffalo had no chemistry
  - Even though she's good at generating chemistry with others 

## Hannah

- Went to see Infinity war in theaters without seeing most of the rest of the
  MCU and did not have a great time

## Hayden

- "[Thor] is like an angel and a pirate had a baby"
- The second time watching it the humor wasn't as funny
  - But enjoyed Dr. Strange winking at Tony Stark
- Enjoyer of Drax
- Crowd pleaser
  - Easy to just turn on and watch
  - Entertaining but not thought provoking
- So much dialogue ruined by memes
- Thanos is just psychotic
  - Dangerous kind of crazy because he is charismatic enough to have followers
- Does he take into account populations he had already halved
- Never shows any of the Asguardians surviving. Did they?
- Everybody's hair looks too good
- The final battle scene does make any sense to charge right after they open
  the barrier
- Didn't feel crowded for a movie with this many character

## Micah

- Chris Pratt is an unlikeable character
  - Does remember him being as obnoxious in other GOTG movies
- Most of the guardians didn't stand out
- Thanos is a really cool villain
- Mark Buffalo not a good actor in this movie
- Good the first time through but not as good the second watch
  - Strong ending with the Thanos just relishing his victory rather than the
    heroes winning

## Parker

- How do you feel about the difference between this and comic books motivation
  of Thanos trying to woo death
  - Micah: Trying to look though provoking but falls short
  - Danielle: Makes it feel thought provoking
  - Parker: More villainous but stupider, whereas the comic made more sense
- Ruined Marvel vs. Capcom just to add hype

## Tiffany

- No thoughts


# Avengers: End Game

## Bennett

- Really liked the part where Thor talked to his mom

## Berat

- Liked the final battle
  - Movie equivalent of a fireworks show

## Chris

- Movies that use time travel that aren't time travel movies kinda invalidate
  the rest of everything
- Clear difference in old Thanos and young Thanos
- Liked the inversion of guilt for Tony and Peter

## Danielle

- Like Tiaka Watiti
- Felt that young Thanos though old Thanos failed
- Poor little Tony
- Hates techno talk and time travel
- Liked the Tony and Nebula interactions
  - First healthy relationship for Nebula
    - But this could have been more developed in this movie
- Though Thor's trauma was more from his failure than the event

## Hayden

- Too long and had already seen it before
  - Started skipping around

## Micah

- Fortnight Scene
  - Parker: Nailed and brought in the gamer audience
  - Bennett: Glad to see the gamer minority represented in popular media
- Not as good as infinity war but better on multiple watches
  - Fan service
    - "Hail hydra" in captain America
- Time travel dumb
  - Fun to watch but bad physics is trash
  - Also hated Captain America's Ending
    - Every timeline is a separate entity so how does he get back
- Nebula is an interesting character but isn't really developed in this one
- Hulk was better in this movie but only post the time heist
- Thor is really the only character with a genuine trauma response to the
  situation
- Antman is a better funny man than Chris Pratt

## Parker

- This movie never happened. The MCU ended with Infinity war
- Movie would have been better without the time travel
  - Just a movie about dealing with loss
- "If they wanted me to hate Thor, they did a really great job"
- Really liked that they added Ronan
