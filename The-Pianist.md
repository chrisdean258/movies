# The Pianist

## Parker

- Please Don't make me feel both sad and morally bad about movies

## Micah

- Acting was very good
- Being a true story, has to be judged in a different fram
  - Paints other side of the Holocause, not just the Death camps
- Gives a compelling take of individual suffering
  - Whereas most takes seem to be collectivistic
- Definitely hard to watch scene
  - Shooting woman in the head
  - Throwing guy in wheel chair out of the balcony
- Probably wouldn't watch again
  - But didn't dislike that he watched it
- True story films are hard
- Hard to watch how suddenly and uneventfully his family was just gone

## Danielle

- In agreement with Micah
- Not a bad movie
- Well acted
- Coherant story
- Upsettingly, a true story
  - Not an easy movie to watch
  - Being a true story didn't make it easier
- Really big thing put into perspective was when the man started eating the
  fallen beans off the ground
- Interesting that it took place in Poland
  - Always the butt of the joke
  - But this movie shows what it's like to be in that situation
- Movie seems to tell alot about the German officer who helped him but what
  about the others
- Might pass the Bechdel test

## Chris

- Though the acting was good
- Powerful story but still a good movie
- Generally in aggreement with Micah
- Interesting to see the disagreement in the community about the appropriate
  actions against the Germans, i.e. uprise vs try to survive
  - Many thought they were just going to a work camp
