# Roman Holiday

### Parker

- Did anyone else watch it alone in the dark on Valentine's Day
- Couldn't care less about the beginning plotline of the movie
- Didn't like the grimy part of the dude
- The part where she has a lovely date and the photographer comic relief was the best part
- Didn't like the fight scene
  - Why didn't the princess go with the gaurds
- Though it was fine
- Movie would be terrible if it weren't for Audrey Hepburn

### Danielle

- Roman holiday was kinda long for an old movie
- Two distinct movies, the coming of age and the romance
  - Least favorite part is the romance
  - Liked the coming of age
- Audrey Hepburn is a fun performer and very charming
  - Lots of style, lots of good
- Did pass the Bechdel Test

### Chris

- Really long and got boring at a point but respeccted the ending of them not
  getting together

### Micah

- Pretty good
- Creepy but thankfully did push that direction
- As good as it could have been
- Sometimes spends too long on things that weren't interesting
- Scenes where the photographer doesn't get the hint
- Unsatisfying in the end
- Fine little time

### Hannah

- Nice
- Partially unwillingly
  - My mom likes old movies
- Kinda weird and old
- Pretty good
