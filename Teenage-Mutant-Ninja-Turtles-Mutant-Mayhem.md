# Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

## Chris

- Pretty big fan of the turts and this movie was pretty good
- Liked the styles and thought it was well thought out

## Danielle

- This is a fun movie, this is a good movie
- Liked it a lot
- The animation was cool
  - Humans looked asymmetrical and weird
  - Pencil scribbles were cool stylistic choice
    - Felt like a teenager made this
- Jokes were pretty good
  - Milking...
    - It came back around
  - Did encounter a "too old for this joke moment"
    - "Bacon egg and cheese"
- Story was good
  - Clearly geared up for a sequel
- Not a huge TMNT fan 
  - Only watched live action from the 90s
  - Understands the character archetypes but feels like they had the wrong
    voice actors pitch wise
- It's no Puss in Boots 2
- Tentatively passed the Bechdel Test

## Micah

- Didn't love this movie
  - Liked it tho
  - Probably just didn't land
- Liked similar things to Danielle
- A few jokes did land pretty well
  - Mega Milker
  - But a lot of them were pretty juvenile
- Liked the cardboard cutouts of the Chrises
- Didn't think the character developments were super interesting
  - Just want to be popular
- Like this iteration of the turtles
  - Actually kids
- Didn't think the payoff of the mutants turning on the big baddy paid off
- Liked the payoff of the humans and mutants working together
