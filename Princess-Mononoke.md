# Princess Mononoke


## Bennett

- Surface level - war bad
  - But is never too late to stop fighting
- Take more efforts to make characters not a bad person
  - Particularly Lady Eboshi
- San's voice actress is terrible
- Ashitaka accepting he's going to die strives to stop the fighting
  - "Its never too late to stop"

## Tiffany
- They had the cakes

## Hayden

- Simple man vs nature film but could be deeper meaning
- Enjoyed the animation and music
- Ashitaka feels bland because he's the viewer -- just an observer
  - Has the most sensible position
  - Just wants to coexist

## Becky

- Enjoyed the nuance of the move
  - Jiko-bo was nice to Ashitaka at the beginning but became an antagonist
- Ashitaka was a bland protagonist
- Also really enjoyed the portrayal of the movie through visuals rather than audio

## Danielle

- The nuance lacked internal conflict
- Nobody learned a lesson
- Lack of character growth for everyone
  - No internal conflict from killing people

## Micah

- Interesting good and bad in everyone
- Interesting main protagonist thrown into everyone
- Ending just ended
  - No internal conflict just the forest died

## Chris

- Movie was too long
- Movie was not great TBH
- Enjoys the animation
