# Moonrise Kingdom

- That one scene could have been left out

## Bennett

- Felt like a book. Would have been better as a book

## Chris

- Wes Anderson pulls off the you're "watching a movie"
- Emotionless dialogue leads to absolute comedy
- Always specifying left handed scissors was funny

## Danielle

- Had seen this movie once before and didn't remember it a lot
- Wanted to watch a Wes Anderson
- Internal conflict present even with the emotionless dialogue
  - Particularly with the policeman and Suzy's parents

## Hayden

- Disoriented by the lightning strike
- Like the scout master jumping over the river
- Liked Social Services lady showing up like "Give me the child"

## Micah

- Flat, symmetric, DIY, like a stage play
- Never felt like there was rising or falling action
  - Unique, enjoyed it for the difference
- Problem with the lightning strike stuff
  - Bizarre and not grounded in reality
- Enjoyed the narrator as a part of the story
- First movie to make me want to watch other movies by this director

## Tiffany

- Sets and visual storytelling were very good
