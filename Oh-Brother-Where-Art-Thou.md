- What a fun little movie
- Less than two hours, beautiful
- Seen it before but still shocked at the scene ordering
  - Just jumps right into the action
- Bop of a soundtrack

- Fun little movie about stopping your ex wife from marrying somone else
- Forget they did blackface ... oof
  - Not fun even though they are saving someone from the clan

## Micah

- This is my favorite Coen brother's movie we've watched
- Characters were alot more interesting than The Big Lebowski
- More defined character motivation and a more interesting world
  - Soundtrack was cool
- Cinematography and colors were coolr
- This movie reads as a critique of people caring about surface things than meaningful things
  - Clooney winning back his uninterested wife
    - When he is revelaed as soggy bottom boys she is more interested
  - Dude is in KKK but the crowd cares about the stopping of the music
- Main trio is very fun
- A couple things take me out of the reality of it
  - Siren scene
  - Ending scene - whole valley gets flooded
    - Oh the protagonists win after all
- Acting was good
- Less than two hours
