# Good Will Hunting

## Chris

- Best movie that I don't want to rewatch
- Best portrayal of the benefits of therapy and the process
- Characterization of Will's intelligence is a little wrong
  - No one trivially does research level mathematics
  - The filmmakers don't seem to have a grip on how smart a person can actually
    be
- Robin Williams was phenomenal
- Will's 21st birthday and him having been drinking the entire film was funny

## Danielle

- The kaleidoscope camera effect at the beginning is rough.
- Stellan Skarsgard!!!
- I forgot how long it takes for Robin Williams to show up in this movie.
- I think Skylar is a great character, and I adore Minnie Driver, but since
  this is a movie about Will, I feel like we don't get a lot of information
  about Skylar. She is almost flawless, but I suppose you could argue her
  holding out for Will is a character flaw in some ways.
- Let's give Robin Williams his due. The man was extremely talented, and if you
  think the scene about the farting wife was overblown, remember Robin Williams
  came up with that off the dome. That was Matt Damon's honest, real-time
  reaction.
- It's a hard pill to swallow when you remember Harvey Weinstein was a producer
  of this film.

### Things I like about this movie:

- I think it's good story telling
- Robin Williams
- Minnie Driver
- I think Matt Damon does a pretty good job of convincing me that he's a
  troubled genius
- Just the sprinkling of Lambeau being an absolute creep throughout the movie,
  great detail

### Things I don't like so much about this movie:

- The cinematography is a bit rough, not gonna lie
- I don't like Will's explanation to Skylar about how he just gets the stuff,
  just tries a little too hard for my taste
- I was a math major, and I don't know what these proofs are - stats for the
  win baby

- This movie does not pass the Bechdel test, like this movie REALLY doesn't
  pass the Bechdel test.

## Hayden

- I liked it
- Good movie. Don't know if I would rewatch it
- Remember is as good but a little bit corny
- Robin Williams was very good in it

## Micah

- Thought this movie was good
  - Good acting
  - Matt Damon, math professor, Robin Williams
    - Matt Damon accent on point
- Don't know what issue Danielle had with the kaleidoscope effect
- Park bench scene was incredible
  - Breaking down Will's character to his face
- No explicit good guys or bad guys
  - Even Robin William's character is flawed
- First movie to make me tear up with the 'Not your fault' scene
- Cannot accurately portray the entire journey of overcoming trauma in 2 hours
- Therapy is not about having a revelation
  - Cannot explain something so complex in such a simple scene
- Does a good job of showing how hard it is to overcome trust issues
  - Will overhearing the argument between Robin Williams and Lambeau was a good
    showing
- Same issues as American History X
  - Good job of showing complex issues
  - But would minorly tweak the story
  - And extend the runtime
    - Flesh out Skylar, etc.

## Parker

- I didn't watch this movie
- No comments
- Doesn't want to make up comments to confuse the readers
