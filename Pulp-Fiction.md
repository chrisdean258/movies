## Danielle

- Liked the movie, generally more than Micah
- Spiritually related to The Big Lebowski
  - We're just along for the ride
- Did not expect the open sequence
- "Masterclass of nonlinear storytelling"
- Least favorite part
  - Kidnapping scene
- Never going to love a movie with a rape scene in it
  - Vibing with the movie up until that point
- Liked it ending with Samuel L. Jackson arc rather than that
- Good time except for that one part
- The characters are all unlikable except for Fabian
  - The only wholesome character
- Uma Thurman's character not bad but liked cocaine
- Never seen some look as uncomfortable on camera as Quentin Tarantino
- Passes the Bechdel test
- Reason Hannah should watch this movie: see a little french woman explain why
  pot bellies are hot on women but not men
- Reason Hannah shouldn't watch this movie: rape scene

## Hannah B

- Remembers liking it even with the weird stuff
- Problematic things 
- Kinda violent
- Cool without the not cool stuff
- Reason Hannah should watch this movie: Iconic and references
- Reason Hannah shouldn't watch this movie: problematic parts
- Very stylistic
- Lots of storylines
  - That all come together at the end

## Hannah H

- Might watch the movie if she has alot of mental capacity and will to watch a
  movie

## Micah

- This movie is decidedly not to my tastes
- Acting is good
  - Except when Tarintino was on the screen
- Didn't expect the splitting into three indy movies that tied together
- Soundtrack and visual style was good
- First Tarintino I've seen
- Gauranteed two things
  - White people saying the n word
  - Uncomfortable focus on someone's feet
- Not a fan of general debauchery
  - Not a fan of stabbing someone for an adrenaline drug
- Enjoyed the third part
  - Samuel L. Jackson's character arc was unexpected
    - But good to see him develop
  - Cool callback to the open sequence
- Reason Hannah should watch this movie: splitting into 3 movies
- Reason Hannah shouldn't watch this movie: bad imagery
