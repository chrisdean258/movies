## Bennett

- Loves the uncle 
  - Theme song so good
  - And the Uncle Ben parallel
- Loved washed up spiderman
- Gwen is just cool
- Worst line: "That'll teach you to make fun of cartoons" - Peter porker
- Best line: "Sometimes I light a match and let it burn down to my fingertips just to feel something" - Spider Noir

## Chris

- A beautiful story
- Well written
- Manages to display the awkwardness of puberty
  - And going to a new school
- Characters feel real
- Liked the spiderman of our universe dying of just helping too much and being
  tired
