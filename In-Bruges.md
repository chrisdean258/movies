# In Bruges

## Berat

- Definitely has edgy/offensive humor
- Liked the black humor that they had
- Like Harry
  - Inanimate object / Sorry I called you and inanimate object
- Bruges represent purgatory
  - Ken represents heaven
  - Harry represents hell

## Bennett

- Didn't think Ray could survive the end
- Well put together
- Very pretty movie
- Overall better than Interstellar

## Chris

- Ray just seemed like a bitchy moaning sad sack
- Where were all the police?

## Danielle

- Favorite part was Ken stopping Ray from killing himself
- Director went to Bruges and experienced the dichotomy  
- Did not pass the Bechdel test

## Micah

- Only complaint I have about this are personal taste
- Lots of clever story telling
- Lots of early interactions pay off in the end
  - Fat Americans causing the tower to be closed
- Not really my style of humor
- All the characters are garbage except Ken, and he's a hitman
- Ray sucks
  - He's a whiney baby
- Is this a Christmas movie?

## Tiffany

- Couldn't understand their accents
