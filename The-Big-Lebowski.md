# The Big Lebowski

## Danielle

- Second time watching this movie, paid more attention this time
- This is a very silly movie
- Not a whole lot of character development, more snippets of life
- Abrupt ending with no resolution but unsure if any resolution would work
- Did not pass the Bechdel test

## Micah

- Had nightmares about watching the movie, not about the movie, about watching the movie
- Weird and absurd movie
- Makes sense that Chris likes it
- Turn your brain off

## Parker

- Might be better the less you pay attention to it
- Very memorable quotes but they didn't finish it
- Not sure if enjoyed the movie
- Don't take it seriously
- The Dude had a somewhat idyllic life
- Did not enjoy the narrator interacting with The Dude
- The Dude not as chill as a dude as expected
- Overall, not resolved to emulate the Dude in my everyday life
