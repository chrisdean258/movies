# High And Low

## Chris

- Same as the others
- Clearly very hot when filming
- This is fully 2 movies stitched together
  - One with the medical intern chase
  - The other with a mastermind kidnapping and extorting a rich man
    - Based?

## Danielle

- Had its highs and had its lows
  - Ba dum tiss
- Too long for sure
- Liked it more than expected
  - Last one was too slow
- Kind fun tho
- Interesting concept with the dilemma of the wrong person kidnapped
- Interesting that it took Gonzo so long to pay the ransom but he was heralded as a her the rest of the movie
- Cops kinda obvious and that's annoying
- Heroin addicts did not do a great job with addiction
- Ending didn't explain everything
  - Movie kept going and thought you might get close but didn't
- Felt casual about capital punishment
- Probably a B
- Definitely didn't pass the Bechdel test

## Micah

- This movie is fine
  - Its OK
- Biggest complaint is the pacing
  - Power napping between the dialogue
  - Could have been 40 minutes after getting the kid back
  - Lots of cop talk
- Liked the first half of the movie
  - Didn't expect the getting the kid back
- Visually uninteresting
  - Pink smoke
  - Thought the entire thing might take place on one set
- Foreshadowing had a good payoff
- Cool watching all the pieces come together
- None of the characters speak to me
- Gonzo's conflict pretty cool
- Motivation of the kidnapping was a bit random
  - Didn't fully use the characters/setting
