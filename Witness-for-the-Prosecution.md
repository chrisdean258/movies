# Witness For The Prosecution

## Chris

- Thought the lawyer's health was the Chekhov's gun
- Best movie compared to expectations
- Will be suggesting to Lisa

## Danielle

- Based on a play by Agatha Christie
- Loved this movie
- Thought it was great
- Loved not thinking hard then a little twist
- Hated everyone in it still enjoyed the movie
- In the end the lesson was don't trust anyone
- Didn't need the twist on the twist
- The wife was the sickest character
  - Loose cannon
  - Unpredictable
- Acting was different back then
  - Wife on the witness stand scene

## Micah

- One woman written to be murdered, one cranky old lady, one to be sexually
  assaulted and then evil, one to be a temptress, and one to be verbally
  assaulted
- I though this movie was sick
- Thought I was going to hate it
- Liked the flashback storytelling
- No weird old movie stuff
  - Except the wife on the stand scene
- Bad acting 
- Didn't matter if he did it or not
- Courtroom scenes were fun
- Paper change out was sick
- The wife is the most interesting character we've seen so far
- Liked the ask of a no spoiler at the end of the movie
- Liked the lady in the courtroom who was super engaged and then ended up being
  the woman he was running away with

## Parker

- 1950s and 60s courtroom dramas are up Parker's alley
- Didn't like the ending
- Bring some popcorn and don't think about it too much
- Didn't matter whether or not he did it
- Perfectly happy following the whims of the main character
- Really liked this movie, but didn't know that it was great
- Thought the twist was going to be the microphone still recording
- Would be great without the second twist
  - Might be the best we've seen so far
- Most watchable of all the movies
