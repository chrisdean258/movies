# American Beauty

## Chris

-  What's the point of this movie
- Fails to be a critique of modern society or rejecting modern society
- Unpleasant to watch in an unsatisfying way

## Danielle

- Are the daughter and boyfriend like the ideal of not putting on a false
  image?
  - Boyfriend is not an OK person
- Why did Kevin Spacey need to be obsessed with the teen?

## Micah

- General critique of putting on an image of happiness
  - Wanting to put on an image is the root of all problems
- The only character that is somewhat healthy is the daughter
  - And that's a bold claim
- Compared to Its Always Sunny
  - Its Always Sunny has entertaining and funny critiques
  - The bad people get their comeuppance
