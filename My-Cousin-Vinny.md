# My Cousin Vinny

## Parker

- Didn't think it held up as well to his memory
- Not a big fan of the prison rape joke
- Premise is solid
- Enjoyable 
- Favorite ongoing joke was the guy who owed Lisa $200
- Still a good time
- The way Vinny treats Lisa while being the heroic protagonist is different than it would be now

## Micah

- This movie rocks
- Big fan
- Fun characters
- Two things I like
  - You already know the outcome at the end
  - Lisa is a sick character who is relevant in the end
- Running gags are fun
- Vinny and Lisa are a fun duo
- Classic two different conversations happening in the same one

## Danielle

- "Ah, it's OK to laugh again"
- Funny, silly movie
- Bad joke
  - Thankfully didn't repeat
- Liked the not being able to sleep
- Lisa is an excellent character
- The ending of this movie reminds me of legally blonde
  - Specialities paying off in the end
- If this movie was on I would watch it

## Chris

- Funny
- Cool to see the south called out for being a good old boy's club
- Mixed on the realism of the court setting
- Definitely an enjoyable watch
