# Del Toro's Pinocchio

## Bennett

- Not the biggest fans
- Too long
- Felt embarrassed of being a musical
- Interesting imagery and plot points
- Fascist wartime Italy does not fit the motif of being a puppet
- Mussolini is short and ugly and that's the joke
- Pinocchio is not great looking
- Sphinx is inconsistent if immortality is good or bad
  - Just needed an excuse to make him a "real boy"
- Not super familiar with the original story
- Pinocchio's song begins the downward spiral of this movie
- He never learns about lying
  - Like that's the point of the first one

## Berat

- It's stop motion? I gotta see it

## Chris

- Big garbo
- Didn't like the stylization in this movie
- Didn't like the story
- Almost no redeeming qualities
  - Only one is half baked Pinocchio

## Danielle

- I didn't like the ending
- 2024 year of crying
  - And this made me cry but I still didn't love it
- Pinocchio saying he won't be a burden anymore hit not at all
  - Gipeto better off without him
- Wish it wasn't a musical
- Liked Ewen McGregor as Jiminy Cricket
- I didn't like the ending
  - Gipeto has lost two sons
  - Oh but he's alive stakes don't matter
- Can't be a real boy if he doesn't grow up
- All Pinocchio's side quests felt unresolved and pointless
- Whale scene was all fake stakes
- Doesn't pass the Bechdel Test
- Kind of a fan of the sacrilege
- Kinda respect the bombing of the kid

## Micah

- It's OK
- Visually incredible
  - Good color
- Cool rendition of Jiminy Cricket
- Liked Gipeto
- Pinocchio is a little whiny bitch boy
  - Cannot speak for his stench
- Not a fan of the musical numbers until the end
- Like the ambient music
- More of a visual spectacle than a plot spectacle
- In general liked the ending
- A lot of the religious imagery was sole there to say this was an adult movie

## Tiffany

- Playing slay the spire and Pinocchio was on the fucking cross
  - What the fuck is going on
- I cry at everything and the end didn't make me cry

## Trevor

- This movie was the best movie for 30 minutes
  - Good ideas cooking
  - Setting and plot setup
- Then it implodes
  - Kitchen on fire and its falling apart
- What's the theme
  - Morality statehood depriving people of rights?
- Sick that Pinocchio gets that kid's dad killed
  - Candlewick should have dies tho
- If it wasn't two hours long it would be better
- Traditional Pinocchio plot and fascism does not work together
- No lessons of morality
- Short fat Mussolini
