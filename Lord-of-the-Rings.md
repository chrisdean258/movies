# Lord Of The Rings

## Fellowship of the Ring

### Berat

- "The fellowship of the ring is no more"

### Chris

- Literally perfect how could you improve
- Favorite movie so far
- Maybe the CGI could be a bit updated in a couple places

### Danielle

- Sympathizes with Micah
- Nice and relaxing and pretty
- If had no idea of what was going on probably wouldn't care too much
- Very exposition heavy
- Galadriel pretty creepy

### Micah

- Opinion is dependent on having seen the Two Towers
- Fine.. OK.. Not bad at all
- Too many characters
  - Aaragorn is neat with his backstory
- Very adventure focused
- Like watching someone else play Dnd
- Give New Zealand a thumbs up

### Parker

- Going back...still has a very slow start
- Pacing is very slow especially in the extended editions
- Exactly as expected
- Is the bridge striking moment by Gandalf the most iconic moment form the
  entire LOTR
  - Micah thinks so


## The Two Towers

### Chris

- Favorite moments but still enjoyed the Fellowship more

### Danielle

- Favorite movie watched so far
- Whole new layer of each characterization
  - Cares more about Borimir after death
    - More caring about Faramir 
- Loved the Ents
- Appreciated how well you can see the battle at night
- Give my love to Samwise Gamgee

### Micah

- The second one is so much better that the first one that it makes the first
  one look bad
  - The first story is linear
  - Actual problem solving in the second one
- Separation of the party makes for much more interesting conflicts
  - Skipping between the stories makes it much more interesting
- Astronomically better
- Faramir not fully characterized

### Parker

- The battle of Helms Deep is the most interesting/best filmed medieval war
  style film ever seen
  - Iconic action
  - Unexpected rain
  - Impressive filming
