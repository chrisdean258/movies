# Lord Of The Rings

## Fellowship of the Ring

### Berat

- "The fellowship of the ring is no more"

### Chris

- Literally perfect how could you improve
- Favorite movie so far
- Maybe the CGI could be a bit updated in a couple places

### Danielle

- Sympathizes with Micah
- Nice and relaxing and pretty
- If had no idea of what was going on probably wouldn't care too much
- Very exposition heavy
- Galadriel pretty creepy

### Micah

- Opinion is dependent on having seen the Two Towers
- Fine.. OK.. Not bad at all
- Too many characters
  - Aaragorn is neat with his backstory
- Very adventure focused
- Like watching someone else play Dnd
- Give New Zealand a thumbs up

### Parker

- Going back...still has a very slow start
- Pacing is very slow especially in the extended editions
- Exactly as expected
- Is the bridge striking moment by Gandalf the most iconic moment form the
  entire LOTR
  - Micah thinks so


## The Two Towers

### Chris

- Favorite moments but still enjoyed the Fellowship more

### Danielle

- Favorite movie watched so far
- Whole new layer of each characterization
  - Cares more about Borimir after death
    - More caring about Faramir 
- Loved the Ents
- Appreciated how well you can see the battle at night
- Give my love to Samwise Gamgee

### Micah

- The second one is so much better that the first one that it makes the first
  one look bad
  - The first story is linear
  - Actual problem solving in the second one
- Separation of the party makes for much more interesting conflicts
  - Skipping between the stories makes it much more interesting
- Astronomically better
- Faramir not fully characterized

### Parker

- The battle of Helms Deep is the most interesting/best filmed medieval war
  style film ever seen
  - Iconic action
  - Unexpected rain
  - Impressive filming

## Return of the King

### Bennett

- Books are like an epic, movies not so much
  - Much easier to watch the movies
    - And yet still really long
  - Lots of action scenes
- Minus fight scenes most of the plot of the movies was necessary
- Interesting that the last battle of it is just to buy Frodo time, not to win
  - Cool, very heroic
- Visually story tell magic while the books its more about spoken word

### Berat

- Why didn't they fly the eagles to Mordor
 
### Chris

- Liked this one the best of them all
- Top 3:
  - Sam saving Frodo from Shelob through raiding the tower
  - Legolas killing the giant elephants
  - Aowyn killing the witch king

### Danielle

- Biggest complaint is the severe lack of ents
- Aowyn was sick in this movie
- Also Samwise wen through a lot of pain and I love him
- Did a lot better with showing the struggle of Frodo's character with the ring
  in the third one
  - Physical wounds and Frodo looking like death
- Could do without the ghosts
- Aaragorn's necklace makes no sense

### Hayden

- I watched this when I was 12
- I like `grond`
- I appreciate the orcs and stuff was practical effects

### Micah

- Very just go kill the bad guy
- Conflict between Sam, Frodo, and Gollum much less interesting
- Samwise the GOAT of the movie
- Rest of the movie was fine
- Not a fan of Legolas or Gimli
- Legolas taking down the elephant things best action scene

### Tiffany

- The problem with watching these movies with Bennett is I say things and he steals them
- Samwise is the best character in the entire series
- Sam and Frodo - I get very romantic vibes from watching them
