# Joker

## Bennett

- This movie assert that mentally unwell people are violent
  - Is stimming scary?
    - Babies stim
- Movie's greatest sin is just being boring
  - End is the best part because its the only part where anything happens
- Thing that bothered me most about this movie is that I had to watch it twice
  a week apart from one another
  - Brutal to sit through the second watching
- Annoying that it won best soundtrack
- Joaquin Phoenix is definitely the Jonkler

## Cali

## Chris

- Why does it feel like this movie is for incels
- Why this movie say mentally unwell people are violent
- Could have made a gritty Joker movie without it being this

## Danielle

- Hated this movie
- Babies are scary
- Fuck I don't want to watch that
- No point at which I enjoyed while I watched it
- Really bad film about mental health
  - Tries to be good but does a bad job
- Don't like villain origin stories
  - Because you have to humanize them some way
  - Always contradicts something this character does
- Joke is clearly a very extreme case of a psychopath
- Worst thing about this movie is how cringy this it is
- This movie does pass the Bechdel test

## Micah

- What the fuck is up with his shoulder blades
- Things I like and don't like
- Things I like
  - Like the idea of an established character portraying some sort of message
    - Class divide + cutting social services are bad
- Never believed the character wanted to get better about his mental health
- Things I didn't like
  - Seems like they don't trust the audience to understand things for himself
    - Whenever it was revealed that the romantic relationship was false having
      to show the real scenes where she wasn't there
- Hard to reinvent a character
  - Hard to take something that is traditionally an incarnation of evil/chaos
    and personifying it
- Fan of character driven stories

## Tiffany

- "The reason I don't like this movie is that I don't like movies lonely white
  boys relate to"
