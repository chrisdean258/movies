# Once Upon A Time In The West

# Chris

- In general it was fine but it but way too long
- Liked the cinematography
- Someone thought really hard about the sound in the movie
  - And made some *interesting* decisions
- Enjoyed the boot scene

# Danielle

- Someone thought long and hard about this movie and made it 3 hours
- "Brought one too few horses. Actually brought two too many"
- "Actually can count to six is I have to"..spins revolver

# Micah

- Watched first hour
- Music was good
- Characters were fairly uniform in their being a man with facial hair
  - Except harmonica
- Boring and slow
- Several instance where they did bad voice replacement
- Cool cinematography

# Parker

- Fatal flaw: this movie is 3 hours for no reason
- Could not imagine choosing to watch this movie over another famous spaghetti western
- Things going for it
  - Henry Fonda
    - Putting him as the bad guy was a good move
- Only refer to Frank by name
  - Frank
  - The protagonist
  - The gentleman bandit
  - The bad guy capitalist
  - The widow
- Music was very good
  - Reveal the person in the scene playing the backing track
- Liked the scene where he arrives the train station
  - But like it should just have happened without the 30 minute lead up
- Hate the gentleman bandit archetype
- Didn't like the twist where they reveal who the protagonist is
- Wrote the part of the protagonist for Clint Eastwood but he wasn't great
- "Cant trust a man who wears suspenders and a belt"
- Non main characters cant actually kill anyone
- Weird scenes surrounding the widow
- Movie would be better cutting widow and Cheyenne at the end
