# Back To The Future

## Bennett

- Time travel could have worked if he hadn't begun to disappear
- Likes this movie despite not like time travel movies in general
- Saw this movie for the first time at the drive in in Maryville
- Sees how this inspired Rick and Morty
- Libyans is a weirdly specific jokes
- Ronald Reagan joke is very specific

## Chris

- Super nostalgic for me
- Didn't see the beginning until I watched it like a dozen times

## Danielle

- I like Back to the Future
- Fun movie
- Holds up OK
  - Def some problematic elements
- Like that assaulting of the girl is a bad thing
- Doc Brown is the morally gray king that is the true test of simping for
  morally gray kings
- Mainly just remembered the dance at the end
  - Johnny B. Good performed by a white man?
- This movie is fun and I will rewatch at some point
- Does not pass the Bechdel test

## Micah

- Thinks this is Danielle's favorite movie of all time except that Biff loses
  in the end
- Generally I liked this movie
- Favorite form of time travel
  - Can affect the timeline
  - Just entertaining
  - Makes the payoff super satisfying
    - Super cool dad
      - Shows character growth
- Don't like the problematic things
  - Sensitive topics that they play off for laughs
  - Libyan terrorists, sexual assault, bullying
- Hates pointless tension
  - The cable falls off in the end
    - Doesn't add to the plot of the movie
      - Getting the parents together
- Spielberg fan
  - Cinematography, pacing, story
- Liked when they made fun of Reagan
