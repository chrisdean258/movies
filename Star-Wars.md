# Star Wars

## Episode IV

### Chris

- In addition to the iconic of this movie mentioned by Micah and Parker
- Music and sound design are insanely
- Interesting that through a certain lens the Rebels are actually just
  terrorists

### Danielle

- Even without watching this as child still has some amount of nostalgia
- Great story for the feels and hero's journey
- Emotional stakes are not there
  - Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru
  - Leia and her planet blown up
- Interesting that in space fighting you lose if you're in front
- Movie does not pass the Bechdel Test

### Micah

- This movie just kinda rocks, right?
- A _few_ scenes that feel like they waste your time
  - Robots splitting before being captured by the Jawas
  - Grapple hook over the gap
  - Tie fighters scene dragged on
- Characters are likeable and full of personality
- One of the strongest visual identities of any movie ever
- Conflict is fun and progresses well
- Enjoyed the humor of this movie
  - Han calling Jabba a wonderful human being
  - "Boring conversation anyway"
  - Lightsaber fight was kinda funny

### Parker

- Don't know if its possible to remove nostalgia from it
- So iconic
- Not very complex
- Just a banger
- Darth Vader - Hes the bad guy
- Hard to critique because of the watching it as a kid
- Perfect generic fictional story done exactly right
- Credit scroll is unacceptable but saved by the soundtrack and the fact its
  Star Wars
- New star wars shows and stuff trying to make the originals worse

## Episode V

### Chris

- Love gremlin mode Yoda
- Love everything that is this movie
- Large amount of character from R2 for being a character without words

### Danielle

- Really liked it
- These movies are emotionally low stakes
- Loved Yoda
- Love R2 and that R2 saves the day so many times in this movie
- Chewie expresses a lot of emotion for a character that doesn't talk
- Loves a training montage
- Leia and Han's dialogue is lovable
- Movie does not pass the Bechdel Test

### Micah

- I hate the romantic subplot
  - Its a disaster
  - Treating Leia like a prize to win
  - Didn't like the dialogue
  - Nothing interesting about it
    - There just to be there
- In general the emotional stakes are better in this one
  - Luke's conflict between staying doing training vs saving his friends
  - Plot twist of Vader being Luke's father
- First movie could be self contained
  - But really go all in on telling these stories in this one
- No wasted time in this movie
- Continues to be sick
- Lando is so sick
  - Before he's even on screen
  - Good example of subplots and character motivation

### Parker

- Weird to think of this movie as the 1970's Infinity War
  - Oh the heroes lost
- When a child this was least favorite movie
  - Purely views these movies as a 6 year old
- Lando has a sick cape
