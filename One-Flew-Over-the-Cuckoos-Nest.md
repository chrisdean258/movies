# One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest

## Bennett

- Watched at 1x speed 8 years ago
- Looked good for how old it was
- Unlike a lot of the movies on this list this movie says something well
  - Psychiatric patients are treated like shit
  - There is no way to prove you are sane
  - People with mental illnesses are still people
- This point is handled better than it might be in other movies
- Movie is sad and depressing
- Appreciate the good message and the focus on the message

## Chris

- Probably recorded on film allowed for good digitization
- Pretty much what the other guys said

## Danielle

- One of my red flag movie
  - If someone said this was their favorite movie
- Doesn't think this movies show people trying to get better
- People who are voluntarily there only don't try to get better
  - Have been conditioned that there is something wrong with them
  - None of them started off bad enough to be hospitalized
- Point is mental hospitals teat their patients terribly
- Really hate McMurphy
  - He shouldn't be idolized
  - He treated the other patients like people
  - But he's a bad person
- This movie hates women
  - You can be a nurse Ratched or a Candy
  - In the book the Nurse Ratched is characterized as evil
  - Vs. in the movie she was more heartless and stern
    - Only 'evil' part is wanting McMurphy lobotomized
- This movie does not pass the Bechdel Test

## Micah

- Liked Bennett's summary
- Once I understood what the premise was, I was worried
  - This can go drastically poorly
  - Though it might be jokes at the expense of neurodivergent people
- Pleasantly surprised
  - These people shown trying to get better
- Liked how it humanized all the characters
- Good relationship building between the main characters and other patients

## Parker

- Thinks Bennett thinks that is was less interesting at double speed than the
  other movie we saw this week but not the least interesting double speed movie
  he's seen
